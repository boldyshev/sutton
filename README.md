# Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction

Python implementation of example experiments (figures) and programming exercises from [Sutton, Barto - Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (2nd ed.)](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2020.pdf)


Chapters are added as I study the book.

Also a lot of useful information [here](http://incompleteideas.net/book/first/the-book.html), e.g. "Readers using the book for self study can obtain answers on a chapter-by-chapter basis after working on the exercises themselves. Send email to rich@richsutton.com with your efforts to answer the exercises for a chapter, and we will send back a pdf file with the answers for that chapter."
